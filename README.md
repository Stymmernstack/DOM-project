Players flip cards to find matching pairs
The game shuffles cards at the beginning.
Matching pairs remain visible; non-matching pairs flip back.

How It Works:
Shuffle Cards: The game initializes with a shuffled set of pairs.
Flipping Cards: Clicking a card reveals an emoji.
Matching Logic: Two selected cards are compared:
If they match, they remain flipped.
If they don't match, they flip back.
Winning Condition: The game ends when all pairs are found.
